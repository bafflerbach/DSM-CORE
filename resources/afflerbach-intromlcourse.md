:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- What is Machine Learning?
- TODO: figure out how to customize this section, currently questions and objectives are hardcoded in.
- we would probably want something like "Type of Content" and "Concepts".
- Could maybe keep objective depending on preferred language

- Introduce ML research workflows
- Data Cleaning, Featurization, Assessment

## Introduction

This curriculum provides students an introduction to using machine learning tools and the associated necessary background on machine learning methods and statistical analysis. Throughout the curriculum, students will focus on using two software tools (Citrination and MAST-ML) to generate machine learning models. They will learn key ideas for assessing model performance and decision making skills for how to improve or modify a model.

It is expected that between synchronous (and asynchronous) meetings, work groups, and completion of activities that students will spend ~9 hours of time on work related to their participation in the Skunkworks Education group each week. This corresponds to approximately a 3 credit hour course if receiving credit for an independent study course.
